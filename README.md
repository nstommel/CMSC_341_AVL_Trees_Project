# CMSC_341_AVL_Trees_Project
This project implements self-balancing Adelson-Velsky Landis (AVL) trees, which are an extension of a binary search tree, which enforces that the â€‹heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. If this rule is violated, the tree is rebalanced and the AVL tree property is restored.
